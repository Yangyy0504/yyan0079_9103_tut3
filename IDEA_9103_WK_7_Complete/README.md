*Snowfall on Mount Fuji Project*

// Inspiration of Imaging Technology

//Inspiration:
In Hayao Miyazaki's animated film *Spirited Away*, a scene shows snow falling slowly against a quiet, distant background.  
The inspiration for this scene was to show the calm and gentle fall of snow, an effect that can be applied to the snow scenery of Mount Fuji to add a sense of nature and immersion. By imitating the uniformity and chance of snowflakes falling, the picture can be made more vivid and realistic.

// Coding Technology Exploration

//Coding Technology:
The object-oriented technology in P5.js achieves the accumulation of snowflakes, and each snowflake object has independent attributes such as position, speed, size, etc. The object mode of P5.js enables each snowflake object to have its own random behavior, such as falling speed, position change, etc., to achieve the natural snowflake effect in this way, and allow snowflakes to accumulate on the ground over time, increasing the realism of the snow scene of Mount Fuji.

//Summary

This project emulates the snowing scene in *Spirited Away* and combines it with P5.js's object-oriented technology to create a snowfall effect over Mount Fuji. Each snowflake behaves and appears randomly, accumulating over time to create a more natural and realistic final image.
